# vinlist2

Simple android project utilizing Room as a database to store VINs (Vehicle Identification Numbers). 

Used multiple sources to complete differents parts of the project.

One totorial for creating multiple activities... another to get the database working.

Project is simple - it is the very beginning of a VIN (vehicle identificaion number) list - so it would ideally have the data entry limited to 17 characters - converted to all caps.  

Open prject and see landing page - use "enter" to view the list page.  Use the "+" floating action button to add a list item.  Use the back button to navigate out of the app.

To delete all vins uninstall app.
