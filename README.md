# vinlist2

Simple android project utilizing Room as a database to store VINs (Vehicle Identification Numbers).

Used multiple sources to complete different parts of the project. Writing first in java, and then rewriting in Kotlin as I having trouble with listeners in and understanding the more verbose java code.

Open the project to the blank list view.  Use the "+" floating action button to add a list (VIN / Notes) item to the MainActivity.Â  Note: The VIN must be no shorter than 17 characters (a Toast wil warn you if its too short).

To Edit/Update tap the entry and it will allow you to change the list item.  The UI logic is a work in progress, but are straightforward.

The main page is a recycle view, so if you add enough items you can scroll down to view more.

To delete all VINs uninstall app.
